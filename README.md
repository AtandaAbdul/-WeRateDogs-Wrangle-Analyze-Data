# -WeRateDogs-Wrangle-Analyze-Data

The dataset I worked on involved analyzing and visualizing tweets from the popular Twitter account @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. This account rates people's dogs with a humorous comment and a rating system that usually has a denominator of 10, but the numerators are almost always greater than 10. The reason for this is because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has gained international media attention. The Twitter archive, which contains basic tweet data, was provided exclusively for this project by WeRateDogs and includes all 5000+ tweets as of August 1, 2017.


The tech stack used in this project includes Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, requests, and tweepy for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.

The main tasks in this project involve data wrangling, including gathering data, assessing it for quality and tidiness issues, cleaning the data, and then storing, analyzing, and visualizing the data. The data was gathered from various sources, including a downloadable file, a file hosted on Udacity's servers, and the Twitter API.

After gathering the data, it was assessed both visually and programmatically for quality and tidiness issues. Issues were documented, and then cleaning was performed to address those issues. The result was a high-quality and tidy master pandas DataFrame.

The cleaned data was then analyzed and visualized in the Jupyter Notebook, producing numerous insights and visualizations. Additionally, two written reports were created: _**Wrangle_report.pdf**_, that briefly described the wrangling efforts, and another _**act_report.pdf**_ that communicated the insights and visualizations produced from the cleaned data.

Overall, this project involved a thorough data wrangling process, using various Python libraries to gather, assess, clean, analyze, and visualize the data, resulting in valuable insights and visualizations.
